# Features

*of **ISC** Cron relative to **BSD 4.2 - 4.3** & **System V** Crons*

<br>

## Environment Variables

*Variables can be set per **CronTab**.*

<br>

### Syntax

```
SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH = .:/bin:/usr/bin
Test = 'This is a test'
Hello = "World"
Values = With Spaces
```

<br>

### Variales

*With special meanings.*

#### `LOGNAME`

Defaults to data in the users `passwd` entry.

#### `MAILTO`

If set, will mail the output of **Cron** to <br>
the user with the specified login name.

Useful if you decide to use `BINMAIL` in `cron.h` <br>
as it doesn't know anything about aliasing.

#### `SHELL`

Defaults to `/bin/sh`.

#### `USER`

Read from the users `passwd` <br>
entry and cannot be changed.


#### `HOME`

Defaults to data in the users `passwd` entry.


#### `PATH`


#### `TZ`

Can be set, but ignored other <br>
than for the command it runs.

<br>
<br>

## Weekdays

*You can specify weekdays by name.*

You need to write the first `3` <br>
characters in whatever you like.

<kbd> Mon </kbd>  
<kbd> Tue </kbd>  
<kbd> Wed </kbd>  
<kbd> Thu </kbd>  
<kbd> Fri </kbd>  
<kbd> Sat </kbd>  
<kbd> Sun </kbd>

<br>
<br>

## Months

*You can specify months by name.*

You need to write the first `3` <br>
characters in whatever you like.

<kbd> Jan </kbd>  
<kbd> Feb </kbd>  
<kbd> Mar </kbd>  
<kbd> Apr </kbd>  
<kbd> May </kbd>  
<kbd> Jun </kbd>  
<kbd> Jul </kbd>  
<kbd> Sep </kbd>  
<kbd> Oct </kbd>  
<kbd> Nov </kbd>  
<kbd> Dec </kbd>

<br>
<br>

## Mixing

Ranges & lists can be mixed.

*Standard Cron doesn't allow `1,3-5`*

<br>
<br>

## Stepping

Ranges can specify a **Step** value.

`10-16/2`  **[≍]**  `10,12,14,16`

<br>
<br>

## Sunday

Can be specified as both `0` & `7`.

*Apparently **BSD** & **ATT** disagree on about this.*

<br>
<br>

## User

Every user gets their own **CronTab** <br>
file like in **System V**s version of **Cron**.

<br>

### BSD 4.2

Only root was allowed to have one.

<br>

### BSD 4.3

- The **CronTab** format was made incompatible.

- Non-root UIDs could run the command.

- Only root could edit the **CronTab** file.

<br>
<br>

## System V Compatibility

The `crontab` command is loosely compatible with <br>
**System V**, but has been extended with more options.

Running the command without arguments <br>
shows a summary on how to use of the it.

<br>
<br>

## Comments

- Must be on a line by themselves

- Can have leading whitespace

- `#` starts the comment

<br>
<br>

## Auto Reloading

If the `crontab` command changes any **CronTab**, <br>
the `cron` daemon will automatically reload all <br>
tables before the next iteration.

<br>

### Other Crons

- may require you have to kill & restart the daemon.

- may unnecessarily read & parse the config continuously.

<br>
<br>

## Access

The **CronTab** files cannot be read nor <br>
modified other than with `crontab` / `cron`.

*This is to allow for automatic reloading.*

This shouldn't pose a problem however, <br>
as `crontab` allows you to do whatever <br>
you want on your on **CronTab**.

With root you can of course <br>
access anyone's **CronTab**.

<br>
<br>

## MailTo

If any output generated by commands on `stdout` & <br>
`stderr` will be mailed to the owner of the **CronTab**.

Alternatively the `MAILTO` variable is used. <br>
⤷ Check the [Environment Variable](#EnvironmentVariables) section.

### Header

The mail messages header will include:

- The command that was run

- The list of passed environment variables

    *Will at least contain:*

    - `SHELL`
    
    - `HOME`
    
    - `USER`
    
        *`LOGNAME` on **System V**.*
    
<br>
<br>

## DOM / DOW

The situation is odd.  

`* * 1,15 * Sun` will run on:

- 1st

- 15th 

- Sundays

`* * * * Sun` will *only* run on:

- Sundays

`* * 1,15 * *` will *only* run on:

- 1st

- 15th.

This is why we keep `e->dow_star` & `e->dom_star` .

I didn't think up this behavior, it's how **Cron** <br>
has always worked but the documentation <br>
hasn't been very clear.

I have been told that some **AT&T Crons** do not <br>
act this way and do the more reasonable thing, <br>
which is - in my honest opinion - to `or` the <br>
various field - matches together.  

In that sense this **Cron** isn't completely <br>
similar to some of the **AT&T Crons** .
